# Projects
This Project is a input parser written in C/C++, and it can determine different tokens of input in the console.
These include lexemes, pipe, and end tokens.
The projects deal with Vectors, memory allocation, and reading input.
Parser.c can shift letters around as necessary.
CharItr.c was written to help iterate through characters one by one.
Node.c helps allocate memory to the proper places.
Str.c can splice, prepend, append words
